## Essential topics to master

### 1. Destructing Objects & Arrays
This is important and necessary whenever we want to get data from an object or array.

### 2. Rest / Spread Operators
Rest = Used to collect multiple elements into an array or object.
Spread = Used to unpack (spread) elements from an array or object.

ðŸ’¡ Quick Rule of Thumb:
If youâ€™re unpacking, itâ€™s spread.
If youâ€™re gathering, itâ€™s rest.

Both are essential in modern frontend frameworks in handling props, managing state and improving code readability

### 3. Template literals 
It is an ES6 feature, modern way of creating strings that allow embedded expressions, multiline strings and enhanced readability.
Explore string interpolation with backticks and embedded expressions.
